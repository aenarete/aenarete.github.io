These loans have a high interest rate of 10.5 &#37;. As a result, in 2024 about 70&#37; of the tax income will be used just to pay the interest on mainly Western loans. As a result, the people in Kenya struggle to survive, there have been huge cuts in the fields of education and health, and many people are dying, only to keep the profit of the creditors up and running.</p> <p>This must be stopped.
