# Youth-driven protests in Kenya in summer 2024

## We mourn the loss of Daniel Njoroge, 8 years old, killed by the police on 28th of June 2024 in Nairobi, Kenya

His family lost their house in the floods in May 2024. After that they could
not afford to send him to school any longer. He was a promising young
man. He opted to join the protesters as he went to look for his sister in
the neighborhood, and that's how his life ended.

Please donate for his family [here](https://bunq.me/climatesolidarity), and add the message: "For Daniel".

## Kenya's Future is strangled by the IMF and World Bank

**By Dianah Mugalizi**

As a concerned Kenyan, I feel compelled to expose the severe consequences of the IMF and World Bank's financial interventions in our country. These institutions, often seen as economic saviors, have imposed loan terms that are driving ordinary Kenyans into despair.

Recently, the streets of Nairobi and other cities have been filled with protests against the high taxes imposed to service these international loans. These demonstrations are cries for help from citizens burdened by economic hardships, unable to see the benefits of these loans. The government's commitment to repaying these high-interest loans has led to increased taxation, exacerbating unemployment and underdevelopment.

The IMF claims to be helping Kenya achieve economic stability, but the reality is different. The stringent conditions attached to these loans often result in austerity measures that hurt the most vulnerable. It's heartbreaking to see the youth, our nation's future, taking to the streets to demand economic justice and transparency.

The protests are ongoing, with 43 young people shot dead, including a 12-year-old boy struck by eight bullets. Over 500 young people are in hospitals with gunshot wounds. Police have used teargas, water cannons, and extreme force against peaceful protesters. We, the youth, will continue to demand justice for our fallen heroes and call for the incompetent government to step aside, including the judiciary, executive, and legislature. We want President William Ruto out. He deployed the Kenya Defense Forces against us instead of protecting us. I will personally continue protesting because healthcare is unaffordable, both for me and my elderly relatives with chronic illnesses.

The unrest is not just about rejecting the Finance Bill 2024; it reflects deeper systemic issues. The lavish lifestyles of government officials, as noted by an IMF official, sharply contrast with the dire conditions of the majority, fueling anger and frustration among Kenyans who feel betrayed by both their leaders and the international community.

President Ruto’s refusal to assent to the Finance Bill highlights the gravity of the situation, but it's not enough. There needs to be a fundamental shift in managing and utilizing these international loans.

The Kenyan government, with international support, must prioritize transparency and equitable development. The IMF and World Bank should consider the social impact of their policies and work towards genuine debt cancellation. Just as the U.S. once canceled Germany’s debt to foster recovery, Kenya needs a similar chance to rebuild without crippling debt.

The protests and tragic loss of lives underscore the urgent need for change. The IMF and World Bank must adopt a more compassionate approach that promotes economic freedom and sustainable development for Kenya. We, the youth, will continue to demand immediate debt cancellation and urge the IMF and World Bank to leave Kenya. We believe Kenya can generate sufficient revenue for its development if finances are well managed. We demand economic justice and a fair future for our country.

As a nation, we must stand united for economic justice. We owe it to ourselves and future generations to demand a fair financial system that works for the people, not against them.
