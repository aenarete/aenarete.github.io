# Youth-driven protests in Kenya in summer 2024

## We mourn the loss of Daniel Njoroge, 8 years old, killed by the police on 28th of June 2024 in Nairobi, Kenya

His family lost their house in the floods in May 2024. After that they could
not afford to send him to school any longer. He was a promising young
man. He opted to join the protesters as he went to look for his sister in
the neighborhood, and thats how his life ended.

Please donate for his family [here](https://bunq.me/climatesolidarity), and add the message: "For Daniel".
