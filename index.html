Notably, it’s as unfair as asking the designated driver to clean up the entire bar after a wild night out.</p> <p>This concept calls for holding wealthier nations, industries, and individuals accountable, as they often contribute the most to emissions while enjoying insulation from the worst impacts.</p> <h2 id=current_situation_in_kenya ><a href="#current_situation_in_kenya" class=header-anchor >Current situation in Kenya</a></h2> <p>East Africa in general and Kenya in particular are badly hit by climate change. There was a drought for many years, costing many lives, and in 2024 floods that were two to four times stronger than usual.</p> <p>The houses of people have been swept away, both in the countryside and in Nairobi.</p> <p>The government made things worse by destroying houses near the river that survived the floods.</p> <p>Furthermore, shortly after the floods, the government announced a new law that would increase a lot of taxes and introduce new taxes on basic goods like bread. This triggered a huge wave of protests. The government decided to withdraw the law, but this will not fix the problems, because IWF and the World Bank demanded tax increases so that Kenya could repay its debts.</p> <p>A real solution needs to include:</p> <ul> <li><p>a debt cancellation, which is justified because the rich countries caused the climate change which is causing at least half of the problems in Kenya</p> <li><p>cooperation in fighting climate change between Kenya and NL, but also on topics like clean energy, clean cooking, women&#39;s rights, sustainable financing, fighting plastic pollution etc. </p> <li><p>more effective fight against corruption and for the protection of human rights, both in NL and Kenya</p> </ul> <h2 id=what_to_do ><a href="#what_to_do" class=header-anchor >What to do?</a></h2> <p>You can:</p> <ul> <li><p>inform yourself about the situation in Kenya, for example by reading this website or the provided links</p> <li><p>support one of the political <a href="/actions/">Actions</a></p> <li><p>show your <a href="/solidarity/">Solidarity</a></p> </ul> <p>Thank you so much for taking Climate Justice seriously&#33;</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Uwe Fechner.
