# Solidarity with climate activists in Kenya
@@img-medium ![alt](/assets/dianah.jpeg) @@
The grassroots activist Dianah Mugalizi founded the Youth Network [Pro Green Shapers](https://youthcollective.restlessdevelopment.org/organisation/pro-green-shapers/). 

## Solidarity with victims of the floods
Dianah Sayi Mugalizi, a climate activist from Nairobi is one of the lucky people who have secured a dry place to live. Dianah is hosting 12 refugees, among them women who are breastfeeding and elder men who need urgent medical attention. They have nowhere to call home now since their homes were carried by water. They dearly need your help with food, basic amenities and emergency housing.

Please, support her in supporting others! 

In 2024 we received about 4500 EUR of donations, which was sufficient for food and housing, but not sufficient to pay the medical costs. Make it possible to provide ongoing support using link below and add the message: "For the flood victims."

Please consider giving a monthly donation: If 10 people would donate 20 EUR per month we could already pay the rent for the small flat. The houses need to be rebuilt, but that will take time.


## Tree planting
Dianah helped to organize a tree planting session along the Mathare River. This was a great opportunity for the group to get outside and do something encouraging: More trees mean a lower risk of floods in the future.

## Solidarity with children who cannot go to school
Heavy rain and a large flood in Kenya in the last weeks displaced more than 281,000 people. Many of them lost everything. Now that school starts again, many children cannot go to school, because they need a school uniform, books and to pay the school fees.

- Family A, they have one child, Michelle - 5 years grade 2. She needs a school uniform, books and school fees to go to school at a cost of 400 EUR.

- Family B has one girl, Rittah - 10 years grade 6. Rittah needs a school uniforms, books and school fees for 400 EUR.

- Family C has one girl, Angela - 8 years in grade 4. She needs support with books, a uniform and school fees for 400 EUR

- Family D has one girl, Rabecca - grade 3, she needs support with school fees, books, a school uniform and transport to school costing 280 EUR. 

In 2024 we received sufficient donations to pay the school fees, but not to pay the other costs, like textbooks, exercise books, colors or crayons, clay soil, pencils, toilet paper(for school), school shoes both sports and black shoes...

For one time donations, please use the link below and add the message "For school children."
