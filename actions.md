A MOVEMENT OF MOVEMENTS 

They are a global grassroots movement initiated and led by the Global South, building power from the bottom-up by uniting workers, Indigenous, feminist, faith, environmental, social and climate justice movements in the Global North and South, to cancel the financial debt of the Global South in order to enable a self-determined, just transition.

Debt is the most powerful common denominator behind which all of these struggles can unite and fight for global social, ecological and climate justice.
