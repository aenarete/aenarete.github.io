Dianah is hosting 12 refugees, among them women who are breastfeeding and a man with a chronic condition. They have nowhere to call home now since their homes were carried by water. They dearly need your help with food, basic amenities and emergency housing.</p> <p>Please, support her in supporting others&#33; </p> <p>In 2024 we received about 4500 EUR of donations, which was sufficient for food and housing, but not sufficient to pay the medical costs. Make it possible to provide ongoing support using the blue button below.</p> <a class=dbox-donation-page-button  href="https://donorbox.org/campaign2024?designation=Support%20the%20refugees%20with%20shelter%20and%20food&amp;default_interval=o" style="background: rgb(18, 138, 237); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; display: flex; font-size: 16px; padding: 8px 24px; border-radius: 5px; gap: 8px; width: fit-content; line-height: 24px;"><img src="https://donorbox.org/images/white_logo.svg" style="display: none;">Donate</a><p/> <p>Please consider giving a monthly donation: If 10 people would donate 20 EUR per month we could already pay the rent for the small flat.
