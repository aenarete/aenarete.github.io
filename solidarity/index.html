In her village she started an agribusiness training for youths and women. Further more she initiated clean cooking and tree planting projects in one of the local schools, combined with environmental education.</p> <p>She came to Nairobi in 2017 but during the holidays she could go back to the village and work on my green projects. In Nairobi I have volunteered for a number of organizations which include Greenpeace Kenya, Kenya Climate Change Working Group, Sustainable Energy Access Association Kenya, Caritus Kitui, The Adventist Development and Relief Agency Kenya, Good Deeds Day, 350 Org, Power Shift Africa, Mathare Youth Space. Through some of the platforms she has been able to take part in climate strikes, clean ups, tree planting, climate educational campaigns, and faith based climate campaigns.</p> <p>Across East Africa, she has worked at the Green Africa Foundation and implemented tree planting and climate change awareness campaign projects in partnership with the Australian High Commission Alumni Associations in Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo. As the Zero Waste Africa Ambassador I have implemented Zero waste projects in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>She also worked on debt cancellation and Waste Management campaigns across Africa.</p> <h2 id=solidarity_with_victims_of_the_floods ><a href="#solidarity_with_victims_of_the_floods" class=header-anchor >Solidarity with victims of the floods</a></h2> <p>In April 2024 strong rain and large floods hit large areas of Kenya. More than 281,000 people lost their houses and were looking for shelter. Dianah converted her flat into a shelter for 13 people who lost their houses. We were able to support this group of people for one year, from April 2024 to March 2024 with shelter, food and health care, and two of the children could go to school.</p> <p>Due to a drop of donations we are not longer able to fully support these refugees, but we would be very happy if you could help us to provide some ongoing support, for example for water and electricity and for the support of one girl who lost her parents and is now an orphan.</p> <p><a href="https://bunq.me/climatesolidarity">Climate Solidarity</a></p> <p>Please consider giving a monthly donation: For 40 EUR per month we can pay water and electricity for a week.</p> <h2 id=tree_planting ><a href="#tree_planting" class=header-anchor >Tree planting</a></h2> <p>Dianah helped to organize a tree planting session along the Mathare River. This was a great opportunity for the group to get outside and do something encouraging: More trees mean a lower risk of floods in the future.</p> <div class=img-medium ><img src="/assets/trees.jpeg" alt=alt  /></div> <p>If you want to donate for tree planting, please use the link below and add the message &quot;For tree planting.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://bunq.me/climatesolidarity">Climate Solidarity</a></p> <h2 id=solidarity_with_children_who_cannot_go_to_school ><a href="#solidarity_with_children_who_cannot_go_to_school" class=header-anchor >Solidarity with children who cannot go to school</a></h2> <p>Heavy rain and a large flood in Kenya in the last weeks displaced more than 281,000 people. Many of them lost everything. Many children cannot go to school, because they need to pay for books and for the school fees.</p> <p>For one time donations, please use the link below and add the message &quot;For school children.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://bunq.me/climatesolidarity">Climate Solidarity</a></p> <h2 id=we_are_also_looking_for_loans_credits ><a href="#we_are_also_looking_for_loans_credits" class=header-anchor >We are also looking for loans/ credits</a></h2> <p>We are also looking for people who could give a credit/loan for</p> <ul> <li><p>paying hospital costs</p> <li><p>paying study fees</p> <li><p>starting a soup kitchen or similar activities to give the refugees a chance to earn their living</p> </ul> <p>If you would be able to provide a loan or credit for one of these purposes, please send an email to info AT climatejusticesolidarity.nl</p> <p>Hospitals in Kenya charge up to 16&#37; interest rate per month&#40;&#33;&#41; for open bills, which is insane.</p> <p>Thank you so much for taking Climate Justice seriously&#33;</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Uwe Fechner.
