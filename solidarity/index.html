Dianah is hosting 12 refugees, among them women who are breastfeeding and elder men who need urgent medical attention. They have nowhere to call home now since their homes were carried by water. They dearly need your help with food, basic amenities and emergency housing.</p> <p>Please, support her in supporting others&#33; </p> <p>In 2024 we received about 4500 EUR of donations, which was sufficient for food and housing, but not sufficient to pay the medical costs. Make it possible to provide ongoing support using link below and add the message: &quot;For the flood victims.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://bunq.me/climatesolidarity">Climate Solidarity</a></p> <p>Please consider giving a monthly donation: If 10 people would donate 20 EUR per month we could already pay the rent for the small flat. The houses need to be rebuilt, but that will take time.</p> <h2 id=tree_planting ><a href="#tree_planting" class=header-anchor >Tree planting</a></h2> <p>Dianah helped to organize a tree planting session along the Mathare River. This was a great opportunity for the group to get outside and do something encouraging: More trees mean a lower risk of floods in the future.</p> <div class=img-medium ><img src="/assets/trees.jpeg" alt=alt  /></div> <p>If you want to donate for tree planting, please use the link below and add the message &quot;For tree planting.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://bunq.me/climatesolidarity">Climate Solidarity</a></p> <h2 id=solidarity_with_children_who_cannot_go_to_school ><a href="#solidarity_with_children_who_cannot_go_to_school" class=header-anchor >Solidarity with children who cannot go to school</a></h2> <p>Heavy rain and a large flood in Kenya in the last weeks displaced more than 281,000 people.
