## Climate Justice

Climate Justice highlights countries’ and communities’ unequal historical responsibility for the climate crisis. Notably, it’s as unfair as asking the designated driver to clean up the entire bar after a wild night out.

This concept calls for holding wealthier nations, industries, and individuals accountable, as they often contribute the most to emissions while enjoying insulation from the worst impacts.

## Current situation in Kenya

East Africa in general and Kenya in particular are badly hit by climate change. There was a drought for many years, costing many lives, and in 2024 floods that were two to four times stronger than usual.

The houses of people have been swept away, both in the countryside and in Nairobi.
